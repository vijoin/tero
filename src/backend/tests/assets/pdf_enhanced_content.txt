Emma's routine
My day usually starts early. I always get up at 7.35 on weekdays, but at the weekends I sleep an hour and a half more. When I get up, I go to the bathroom first. I wash my face, brush my teeth and then I have a shower.
After that, I comb my hair and get dressed. I usually wear casual clothes, jeans, shorts, T-shirts and trainers. I always have breakfast with my mum and my little brother, Tommy. My dad never has breakfast with me because he starts work early on weekdays. I usually have a bowl of cereal with milk and toast with marmalade before I go to school.
I usually walk to school because I don't live very far. Classes start at 8.30. I have two breaks, at 11 and at 1 o'clock. After the last break, I always eat a sandwich with salad and drink orange juice with some fruit at 12 o'clock. School finishes at 3.30 pm. I take the bus to go back home because I'm usually tired after school to walk.
After I arrive, I play with my brother for a while and then I do my homework and study. I have dance classes two days a week. Before dinner, I sometimes meet my friends or watch TV. I sometimes play computer games at that time too. We have dinner at 8.30. After dinner I read a book or surf the Internet for a while. At 10.30 I go to the bathroom to have a shower, and brush my teeth. Before I go to sleep I listen to music for some minutes on my smartphone because it makes me feel relaxed.
