To run Tero locally:

1. Generate an OpenAI API key or an Azure OpenAI endpoint and key.
2. Copy `src/sample.env` to `.env` in the project root and set `OPENAI_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
3. Start the app and dependencies with `docker compose up -d`.
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` and log in with username `test` and password `test`.
