2. Generate an OpenAI API key or an Azure OpenAI endpoint and key.
3. Copy `src/sample.env` to `.env` and set `OPENAI_KEY` or `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.
4. Start the app and dependencies:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:8000` and log in with username `test` and password `test`.

::: info
Some tools (e.g., `Web`, advanced file processing for `Docs`) require additional configuration. Check comments in `src/sample.env` for details.
