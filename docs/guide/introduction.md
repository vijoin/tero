Tero is an open-source platform to create, share, and use AI agents that accelerate and improve software quality practices across your team. It is collaborative by design, secure by default, and extensible so you can adapt it to your workflows and tools.

### What you can do with Tero

- ✅ Build purpose-specific agents that understand your context and processes.
- 🔌 Use built-in tools (e.g., web, documents, Jira, MCP); see the [Tools section](./agents.md#tools) in the sidebar for the full list.
- 💬 Chat with agents, attach files, iterate on prompts, and inspect their reasoning.
- 🧪 Validate agent behavior with tests, measure impact, and manage costs.
- 🖥️ Run Tero locally or integrate it into your existing developer tooling and browser.

### Who is this for?

- QA engineers, SDETs, and developers who want reusable AI agents that empowers them.
- Team leads looking to adopt AI with security, governance, and cost controls.
- Teams that need agents to run where they work (IDE, browser, CI) and fit existing workflows.

### Why Tero?

- **Reusable and collaborative**: Share agents and their knowledge across teams.
- **Secure by design**: Use your preferred model/provider and deployment setup.
